 ATP Tour Match Winner Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Introduction
This repository contains the work of Jakey Kluger, a senior undergraduate student majoring in Engineering and Computer Science, focused on predicting ATP Tour match winners using Machine Learning techniques. The project uses data from Jeff Sackmann’s GitHub repository and applies various machine learning models to predict outcomes of tennis matches.

## Project Overview
- **Data Acquisition:** Comprehensive data on ATP Tour matches sourced from Jeff Sackmann’s GitHub repository.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracting and processing statistics such as player age, height, win rates, serve percentages, etc.
- **Model Implementation:** Implementation of various machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbors, and Neural Networks.
- **Analysis and Selection:** Evaluation of model results to determine the most effective approach.

## Models
- Baseline (Rank)
- Logistic Regression
